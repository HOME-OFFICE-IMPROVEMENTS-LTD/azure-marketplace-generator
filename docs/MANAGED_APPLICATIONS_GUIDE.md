# Azure Managed Applications - The Complete Picture

## What Are Azure Managed Applications? 

Azure Managed Applications (AMA) are **NOT** about individual resources - they're about **packaging solutions** for the marketplace.

Think of it as: **"How do I sell my complete solution on Azure Marketplace?"**

## The Big Picture

```

Traditional Way:          Managed Application Way:
User deploys VM    ‚Üí      User buys "WordPress Solution"
User configures DB ‚Üí      Gets: VM + Database + Storage + Setup
User sets up storage ‚Üí    With: Custom UI + Management Views
User manages all   ‚Üí      Vendor manages infrastructure

```
