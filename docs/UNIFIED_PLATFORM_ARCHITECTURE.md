## 🎯 **Strategic Pivots Based on Market Intelligence**

### **PIVOT 1: Replace WordPress with AI Governance Suite** ✅
**OLD**: WordPress managed application (commoditized, thin margins)
**NEW**: AI Governance managed application suite with policy-as-code, audit logging, responsible AI tooling

### **PIVOT 2: Launch Industry Compliance Accelerator** 🚀
**Focus**: Healthcare/Finance sovereign data mesh landing zones
**Bundle**: FinOps + carbon analytics for ESG mandates
**Target**: Enterprise compliance requirements (HITRUST, PCI-DSS, SOC 2)

### **PIVOT 3: Modular Subscription Pricing** 💰
**Model**: Tiered subscriptions + expert services + usage meters
**Revenue**: Ongoing enterprise value capture vs one-time licensing
**Add-ons**: Implementation packages for complex vertical variants

  // Solution category modules
  solutionModules: {
    aiGovernance: AIGovernanceModule;
    sustainabilityFinOps: SustainabilityModule;
    sovereignDataMesh: DataMeshModule;
  };

  // Shared services
  sharedServices: {
    complianceEngine: ComplianceFramework;
    policyAsCode: PolicyEngine;
