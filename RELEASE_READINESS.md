## Bugs Fixed During Testing

### 🐛 Bug #1: Package Command Path Validation
**Issue**: Package command failed with paths like `./test.zip`  
**Root Cause**: Security validation regex didn't handle path prefixes  
**Fix**: Extract basename before validation in `validatePackageFileName()`  
**Files Changed**: `src/utils/security-validation.ts`  
**Test**: ✅ Verified with `./test.zip` and `packages/subdir/file.zip`

### 🐛 Bug #2: Missing Parent Directory Creation
**Issue**: Package command crashed when output directory didn't exist  
**Root Cause**: No `fs.ensureDir()` call for output directory  
**Fix**: Added directory creation before creating write stream  
**Files Changed**: `src/cli/commands/package.ts`  
**Test**: ✅ Verified with `packages/my-app-v1.0.zip`

## Known Limitations (By Design)

1. **Storage Only**: Only supports Azure Storage managed applications
2. **ARM-TTK**: Requires PowerShell (Windows/Linux with pwsh)
3. **Node Version**: Requires Node.js 18+
4. **Platform**: Tested on Linux, should work on macOS/Windows

## Deployment Commands

### Option 1: Direct Replacement (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Ensure all changes committed
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: Package command path validation and directory creation"

# 2. Replace develop with storage-only
git checkout develop
git reset --hard storage-only
git push --force origin develop

# 3. Update main
git checkout main
git reset --hard develop
git push --force origin main

# 4. Tag release
git tag -a v3.0.0 -m "Release v3.0.0: Production-ready storage AMA generator"
git push origin v3.0.0

# 5. Create GitHub Release
# Go to: https://github.com/HOME-OFFICE-IMPROVEMENTS-LTD/azure-marketplace-generator/releases/new
# Tag: v3.0.0
# Title: v3.0.0 - Production-Ready Storage Generator
# Description: See CHANGELOG.md
```

### Option 2: Merge Strategy

```bash
# 1. Commit changes
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: Package command improvements"

# 2. Merge to develop
git checkout develop
git merge -X theirs storage-only -m "feat: Major cleanup - storage-only focus"

# 3. Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge develop

# 4. Tag and push
git tag -a v3.0.0 -m "Release v3.0.0"
git push origin main develop v3.0.0
```
