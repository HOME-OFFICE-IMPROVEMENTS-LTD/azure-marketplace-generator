# 🎯 WIKI UPLOAD - FINAL INSTRUCTIONS

## ✅ STATUS: 100% READY - ONE CLICK AWAY!

All wiki content is complete and automation is in place. Here's exactly what to do:

---

## 🚀 ONE-TIME SETUP (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Initialize Wiki (30 seconds - Web UI Only)

**Why needed:** GitHub requires the first wiki page to be created through their web interface to initialize the wiki repository.

**Do this:**

1. **Click this link:** https://github.com/HOME-OFFICE-IMPROVEMENTS-LTD/azure-marketplace-generator/wiki

2. **Click the green button:** "Create the first page"

3. **Type anything:**
   - Title: `Home`
   - Content: `Initializing...`
   
4. **Click:** "Save Page"

✅ **That's it!** Wiki repository is now created.

---

### Step 2: Run Automated Upload (1 minute - Fully Automated)

**From your terminal in the repository root:**

```bash
./scripts/setup-wiki.sh
```

**That's ALL you need to do!**

The script will automatically:
- ✅ Verify GitHub CLI authentication
- ✅ Clone the wiki repository
- ✅ Copy all 10 markdown files (6,700+ lines)
- ✅ Remove internal tracking files
- ✅ Commit changes
- ✅ Push to GitHub wiki
- ✅ Show success message

**Expected output:**
```

## 🔄 FUTURE UPDATES (Automatic!)

After the one-time setup above, **you never need to do anything manually again!**

### Automatic Synchronization

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/sync-wiki.yml`) is already configured:

**When you:**
- Edit any file in `wiki-content/` directory
- Commit and push to `develop` or `main`

**GitHub Actions automatically:**
1. Detects the change
2. Clones the wiki repository
3. Copies updated files
4. Commits and pushes to wiki
5. Updates live within seconds

**Zero manual intervention forever!**
