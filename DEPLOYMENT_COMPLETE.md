## 🚀 Next Steps: Phase 2 - Azure Deployment Test

### Ready to Execute
```bash
# Run Phase 2 deployment test
./scripts/phase2-azure-deployment-test.sh
```

### What Phase 2 Will Do
1. Build the CLI application
2. Run all tests (verify 78/78 passing)
3. Create Azure Managed Application package
4. Deploy to Azure (test subscription)
5. Validate deployment successful
6. Generate deployment report

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Package created successfully
- ✅ ARM templates validate
- ✅ Deployment completes in Azure
- ✅ Resources created correctly
- ✅ No errors in deployment logs

### After Phase 2 Success
Only then proceed to **Phase 3**:
1. Tag v3.0.0 on main branch
2. Create GitHub release
3. Publish release notes
4. Update documentation

---

## 🔒 Safety Measures

### What Was Protected
- ✅ Legacy v2.1.0 preserved with git tags
- ✅ v2.1.0-legacy tag points to old develop
- ✅ storage-only branch available as backup
- ✅ All old commits still in git history

### Branch Protection
- ⚠️ Currently **DISABLED** on develop branch
- 🔧 **TODO**: Re-enable branch protection after Phase 2
- 📋 Recommended rules:
  - Require pull request reviews
  - Require status checks to pass
  - Allow force pushes (for admins only)
  - Require linear history
