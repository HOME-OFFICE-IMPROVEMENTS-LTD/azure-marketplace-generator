# Repository Protection Configuration

## Recommended Settings for Professional Workflow

### For GitHub Repository:

#### Main Branch Protection Rules:
```bash
# Enable via GitHub UI: Settings > Branches > Add rule
Branch name pattern: main

☑️ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB  
☑️ Require a pull request before merging
  ☑️ Require approvals: 2
  ☑️ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
  ☑️ Require review from code owners
☑️ Require status checks to pass before merging
  ☑️ Require branches to be up to date before merging
☑️ Require signed commits
☑️ Include administrators (recommended)
☑️ Allow force pushes: Never
☑️ Allow deletions: Never
```

#### Develop Branch Protection:
```bash
Branch name pattern: develop

☑️ Require a pull request before merging
  ☑️ Require approvals: 1
☑️ Require status checks to pass before merging
☑️ Allow force pushes: Only for administrators
```

### Alternative: Local Git Hooks

If using GitLab/other platforms or want local enforcement:

#### Pre-push Hook (.git/hooks/pre-push):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Prevent direct pushes to main branch

protected_branch='main'
current_branch=$(git symbolic-ref HEAD | sed -e 's,.*/\(.*\),\1,')

if [ $protected_branch = $current_branch ]; then
    echo "🚫 BLOCKED: Direct push to main branch is not allowed!"
    echo "Use feature branches and pull requests instead."
    exit 1
fi
```

## Benefits of This Strategy:

✅ **Stability**: Main branch always contains working code
✅ **Review Process**: All changes reviewed before merging
✅ **Traceability**: Clear history of features and fixes
✅ **Rollback**: Easy to revert problematic changes
✅ **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work safely
✅ **Quality**: Automated checks before production

## Quick Commands for Daily Workflow:

```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature

# Work on feature
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement new feature"
git push origin feature/my-new-feature

# Merge back (via PR in GitHub UI)
# 1. Create Pull Request: feature/my-new-feature → develop
# 2. Review and test
# 3. Create Pull Request: develop → main
# 4. Deploy from main
```

## Current Status:
- ✅ Main branch: Protected (stable storage template)
- ✅ Develop branch: Integration ready
- ✅ Feature branch: event-grid-integration created
- ⏳ Protection rules: Apply via repository settings
